## Unfortunately, the way I'm building go currently is to
## use a go bootstrap tarball that was cross compiled on 
## FreeBSD. This was build for amd64, and so to bootstrap
## go, we need to build the initial packages on amd64.
## Go *should* still be able to be build on other arches,
## but will depend on an existant go package for
## bootstrapping.
##
## Supposedly go1.4.3 can be built on plan9 and used for
## bootstrapping, but I always run into panics when building
## on amd64, even with the SMP patch. Maybe someone else
## has had better luck, in which case please submit a patch
## for this template.
